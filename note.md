### HAPPY NEW YEAR 2023 ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†

- [General] Support Bluestacks, needs [app_process wrapper](https://github.com/HuskyDG/app_process_wrapper/releases) to run Zygisk, overwise it will be bootloop
- [Module] Live patch `sepolicy.rule` if it is not found in sepolicy.rules directory, especially `magiskinit` on some old devices cannot mount partition that stores `sepolicy.rule`
