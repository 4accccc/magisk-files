# Magisk Delta Internal Documentation

## Early-init mount

- Some files requires to be mounted earliest in the boot process, Magisk Delta has provided the way to mount files in `pre-init` stage, before `init` is executed
- The one of following location is used as place to store files for early-mount.d (`$PREINITDIR/early-mount.d`):
  - `/data/adb/early-mount.d` (Ext4, Data encryption is disabled)
  - `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d` (Ext4, File based Encryption)
  - `/cache/early-mount.d`
  - `/metadata/early-mount.d` (*)
  - `/persist/early-mount.d` (*)

> The location is decided by magiskinit: magiskinit will check each location in the top-down list if it's usable (is it on the ext4 partition or mountable in preinit?)

> (*) Be careful when device can only use persist or metadata for early-mount, these partitions are very limited in size. Filling up them might cause device unable to boot.

- You can place your files into the corresponding location under `early-mount.d` directory. For example, you want to replace `/vendor/etc/vintf/manifest.xml` and your mount directory is `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d`, copy your `manifest.xml` to `/data/unencrypted/early-mount.d/system/vendor/etc/vintf/manifest.xml` , Magisk Delta will mount your files in the next rebootâ€‹
- Other files are not in `$PREINITDIR/early-mount.d/system` will be ignored.
- For module developers, you can use this path:
```
$(magisk --path)/.magisk/mirror/early-mount
```


**Early-init mount only support simple mount, which means it can replace files but cannot add new files, folders or replace folders**

## init.rc inject

- Feel annoying when you must repack boot image to inject custom `*.rc` script by using `overlay.d`? Magisk Delta has provide the way to inject custom `*.rc` script systemlessly!
- The chose location of custom `*.rc` script is `$PRENITDIR/early-mount.d/initrc.d`. Magisk Delta will inject all scripts in this folder into `init.rc` every boot.
- You can use `${MAGISKTMP}` to refer to Magisk tmpfs folder. Every occurrence of the pattern `${MAGISKTMP}` in your `*.rc` scripts will be replaced with the Magisk tmpfs folder when magiskinit injects it into `init.rc`.
- Magisk's mirror will not be available while booting, in order to access to the copy of `early-mount.d` directory. You can use this pattern `${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d`.
- For module developers, you can use this path:
```
$(magisk --path)/.magisk/mirror/early-mount/initrc.d
```
- Here is an example of the `custom.rc` if you use `initrc.d`:

```
# Use ${MAGISKTMP} to refer to Magisk's tmpfs directory

on early-init
    setprop sys.example.foo bar
    insmod ${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d/libfoo.ko
    start myservice

service myservice ${MAGISKTMP}/.magisk/early-mount.d/myscript.sh
    oneshot
```


## Remove files and folders

- Magisk has module feature which allows users to add and replace files in system without making actual changes to system partitions, so you still can receive OTA,... However, Magisk module does not allow users to make some files in system become invisible.

- In Magisk documentation:

> It is complicated to actually remove a file (possible, not worth the effort). Replacing it with a dummy file should be good enough

> It is complicated to actually remove a folder (possible, not worth the effort). Replacing it with an empty folder should be good enough. Add the folder to the replace list in "config.sh" in the module template, it will replace the folder with an empty one

- In some case, replace file or folder with blank one is not enough and might cause issue. And some modding require files to be disappeared in order to take effect. So Magisk Delta has added removal support for modules. Replacing the target which you want to be deleted with the broken symlink point to `/xxxxx`. When Magic mount happened and detected this symlink, the target will be ignored and disappeared.

- Example creating symbolic link as `/data/adb/modules/mymodule_id/system/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf`, the target `/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf` will be ignored and disappeared:

```
ln -s "/xxxxx" /data/adb/modules/mymodule_id/system/vendor/etc/thermal-engine-normal.conf
```

## MagiskHide 

- The basic hide feature of Magisk. Hide Magisk and its modifications from chosen apps on hidelist.

### How does MagiskHide work?

- The implementation of MagiskHide is ptrace Zygote process, every forks of Zygote will be notified and traced also.
- Does not like MagiskHide from Magisk v23.0 which monitors every thread spawn event of Zygote fork (app process is heavily a multithreads process which will spawn threads to trigger MagiskHide to check UID and cmdline)
- There is an exception that app zygote does not spawn threads and thus it won't trigger MagiskHide to unmount Magisk and detach.
- To fix this problem, we trace the syscalls `prctl()` instead of thread spawn event of Zygote fork like MagiskHide in Magisk v23.0
- After processes has been forked from zygote, there will be atleast `prctl()` is called to change the process name. For normal app process and isolated process, the process name will be changed as followed: 
  - `zygote` -> `(unknown name)` -> `<pre-initialized>` -> `(process name)`. So the key is `<pre-initialized>`, after that we can guess it is target process or not.
- For app zygote, there is only once `prctl()` is called to change process name: `zygote` -> `package.name_zygote`.
- The changing process name happens before apk is being loaded so we can detach it from ptrace, do unmount all Magisk files and nearly there is no traces left after that.


## MagiskHide SuList

- Magisk is hidden or unmounted by default, only chosen apps on sulist will have Magisk environment.
- If the apps don't detect `su`, stop it forcibly and try again.
- The modules function might not working well and need few tricks to make it work and prevent it from breaking the system.

### SuList Tips

- In order to make modules more compatible with SuList, Magisk Delta supports mount module for SuList apps again after all modules file are directly unmounted from zygote process. However, it is better to enable Core-only mode before switching to SuList, add necessary apps to load modules then enable modules and reboot. If there is something wrong (SystemUI crashs), you can connect your device to adb and disable sulist by this command and reboot:

```
adb shell su -c magisk --hide sulist disable
```

- Theme modules usually need SystemUI, Settings and Launcher to always be added to SuList to prevent crashing, there might be additional apps need to be added also
